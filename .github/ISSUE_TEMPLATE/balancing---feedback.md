1. - [ ] I have done a quick search in the list of suggestions to make sure this has not been suggested yet.
2. - [ ] I have checked the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/aE2tcUwF/mindustry-trello) to make sure my suggestion isn't planned or implemented in a development version.
3. - [ ] I am familiar with all the content already in the game or have glanced at the wiki to make sure my suggestion doesn't exist in the game yet.
4. - [ ] I have read `README.md` to make sure my idea is not listed under the "A few things you shouldn't suggest" category.
