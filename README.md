# Mindustry-Suggestions
This is the repository for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) suggestions and feedback.

For bug reports, use the [Mindustry issue tracker](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/issues/new/choose).

## How do I know if you've read my suggestion?

If it's been two days, I've most likely read it. I check this repository regularly - **yes, really**. It is not just a dump of issues that never get read. If I like something, I'll implement it. 

Some assume that, because I am not commenting on every suggestion detailing *why* I will not implement something, I am not reading these issues - *this is not the case*.  

## Why I haven't implemented your suggestion yet

Because most suggestions are bad. The overwhelming majority are rejected because they fall into one (or more) of the categories below:

- It's too niche or not sufficiently useful to warrant adding to the game.
- It is infeasible to implement or not worth the effort.
- It's just a bad idea and would negatively impact the game.
- It's *not* a bad idea, but I don't have time to implement it or have different priorities - usually, suggestions like this get the "candidate" tag.
- It's one of the things I have explicitly mentioned in the list at the end.
- It's already in the game and you didn't notice.
- It is written in a language I don't understand.
- It is incomprehensible or poorly written.

## I will no longer be commenting or closing issues here.

Manually closing invalid or completed requests is tiring. I'm not going to explain why I don't like your suggestion anymore - I just won't do anything. If I think it's good, you'll see it in the game soon enough, and it's your responsibility to close the issue if you so choose.

In very rare cases, I may ask for clarifications or start a general discussion on an issue, but that's unlikely to happen to most things posted here.

## A few things you shouldn't suggest
##### These have been proposed many times already, and I won't be adding them.

- Mechanics that increase game speed (fast-forward)
- New planets
- Teleporters
- Underground map layers
- Trains, or any transportation system that uses something analogous to rails
- Item-liquid junctions
- Controller support
- Turrets on top of cores, or similar "merged behavior" blocks like turrets with drills
- Built-in cloud sync
- Any kind of account system
- Additional configuration of blocks, such as I/O side configuration
- Configuring drill outputs or selecting which resource to mine
- Removing metaglass from the water extractor recipe
- Carrying aircraft with naval units
- Preview of unit paths or waves
- Any sort of string manipulation in logic (splitting strings, joining strings, etc)
- Allied teams
- Bringing back overflow-sorter chaining
- Anything involving bringing back the old command system
