# Mindustry-Suggestions
This is the repository for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) suggestions and feedback.

For bug reports, use the [Mindustry issue tracker](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/issues/new/choose).

## How do I know if you've read my suggestion?

If it's been 24 hours, I've most likely read it. I check this repository daily. If I like it, I'll implement it.  
*However*, If your request is in a language I don't understand and clearly doesn't follow the template, I am unlikely to bother reading it.

## I will no longer be commenting or closing issues here.

Manually closing invalid or completed requests is tiring. I'm not going to explain why I don't like your suggestion anymore - I just won't do anything. If I think it's good, you'll see it in the game soon enough, and it's your responsibility to close the issue if you so choose.

In very rare cases, I may ask for clarifications or start a general discussion on an issue, but that's unlikely to happen to most things posted here.

## A few things you shouldn't suggest
##### These have been proposed many times already, and I won't be adding them.

- Mechanics that increase game speed (fast-forward)
- Teleporters or similar behaviors/mechanics/blocks that achieve mass item transportation between two locations "instantly", such as sorter + overflows
- Underground map layers
- Trains, or any transportation system that uses something analogous to rails
- Item-liquid junctions
- Controller support
- Turrets on top of cores, or similar "merged behavior" blocks like turrets with drills
- Built-in cloud sync
- Additional configuration of blocks, such as I/O side configuration
- Removing metaglass from the water extractor recipe
- Carrying aircraft with naval units
- Preview of unit spawn locations, paths or waves
- Any sort of string manipulation in logic (reading from message blocks, reading characters, splitting strings, etc)
