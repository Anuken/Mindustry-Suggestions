# Mindustry-Suggestions
This is the repository for Mindustry suggestions and feedback. 

For bug reports, use the [Mindustry issue tracker](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/issues/new/choose).

## A few things you shouldn't suggest
##### These have been proposed many times already, and I won't be adding them.

- Mechanics that increase game speed (fast-forward)
- Teleporters
- Underground map layers
- Trains, or any transportation system that uses something analogous to rails
- Item-liquid junctions
