# Mindustry-Suggestions
This is the repository for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) suggestions and feedback.

For bug reports, use the [Mindustry issue tracker](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/issues/new/choose).

NOTE: Read the bottom category, as there is a new category: **"Replying Guidelines"**

## How do I know if you've read my suggestion?

If it's been 24 hours, I've most likely read it. I check this repository daily. If I like it, I'll implement it.  
*However*, If your request is in a language I don't understand and clearly doesn't follow the template, I am unlikely to bother reading it.

## I will no longer be commenting or closing issues here.

Manually closing invalid or completed requests is tiring. I'm not going to explain why I don't like your suggestion anymore - I just won't do anything. If I think it's good, you'll see it in the game soon enough, and it's your responsibility to close the issue if you so choose.

In very rare cases, I may ask for clarifications or start a general discussion on an issue, but that's unlikely to happen to most things posted here.

## A few things you shouldn't suggest
##### These have been proposed many times already, and I won't be adding them.

- Mechanics that increase game speed (fast-forward)
- Teleporters
- Underground map layers
- Trains, or any transportation system that uses something analogous to rails
- Item-liquid junctions
- Controller support
- Turrets on top of cores, or similar "merged behavior" blocks like turrets with drills
- Built-in cloud sync
- Additional configuration of blocks, such as I/O side configuration
- Removing metaglass from the water extractor recipe
- Carrying aircraft with naval units
- Preview of unit spawn locations, paths or waves
- Any sort of string manipulation in logic (reading from message blocks, reading characters, splitting strings, etc)
- Allied teams
- Bringing back overflow-sorter chaining

## Replying Guidelines (>= 6/6/2022)
##### All responses to topics beyond 6/6/2022 should follow these guidelines.

1. Responses SHOULD be a follow-up of what you are replying to, and shouldn't derail the thread's topic or current point (unless required, like if a Topic Fire was active)
2. Responses SHOULD be constructive if it is criticism. Both positive and negative is accepted, but intently bringing nothing to the topic other than bullcrap is not tolerated, and can easily get yourself voided from topics in terms of topic contribution
3. Responses SHOULDN'T boycot topics or users. If you have nothing good to contribute, don't reply
4. Responses SHOULDN'T be created with the intent and capability of causing a Topic Fire *(a scenario where the topic's purpose is voided over a heavy conflict between two or more contributors)*
5. Responses SHOULD be respectful to other users
6. Responses CAN appreciate the cat at all times *(when applicable)*.
